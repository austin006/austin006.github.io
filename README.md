# Who am I?

<img src="Images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" width="300" height="300">

My name is Austin. I love to learn and am constantly trying out new things. My continual yearn for knowledge, and being willing to seek it out, has cultivated my passion for self-advacement in all aspects of my life. Whether it is studying for a difficult class, learning to juggle on a unicycle, doing a backflip, or anything else, I am driven to learn. 

In fact, that's pretty much the motivation behind creating this website, I thought it would be cool to build my own website and so I decided to learn how.
