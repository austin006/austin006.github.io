# Who am I?

My name is Austin. I love to learn and am constantly trying out new things. Whether it is a new skill like juggling or something more random like singing the alphabet backwards, I am driven to learn. In fact, that's pretty much why I made this website, it started as a cool thought I had and grew into it's current state... keep writing the rest of my bio.
