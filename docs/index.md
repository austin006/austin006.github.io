## Bio

![Profile Picture](assets/profile.jpg){ align=left width=25% style="border-radius: 50%; object-fit: cover;" }

<span style="font-size: 2em;">**Austin McGlashan**</span> 

After graduating high school, I lived in Brazil for two years as a religious volunteer. I began studying Mechanical Engineering at Brigham Young University in 2023. I love to learn and am driven by an insatiable curiosity of the world around me. Aside from my academic endeavors, I enjoy many other interests including sports and music.
