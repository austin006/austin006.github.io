# L Level Rocket - Advanced Launch Competition

## :material-notebook: Description

I helped build this rocket in a team of 5. We flew it with a massive **L1000 motor**. The rocket was just under **7ft tall**, flew **Mach 1.465** during launch, and reached an apogee of **~8,000ft**.

Our purpose was to compete in the [Advanced Launch Competition](https://rocketry.byu.edu/join-us/advanced-student-launch-comp/) (ALC) with goal to hit a target altitude of 5,000ft (almost 1 mile).
