I created a light following robot as part of the BYU ECEN 301 course. The labs were divided into 6 parts as listed below:

- Lab 1:  Introduction to Arduino
- Lab 2:  State machine for light following robot
- Lab 3:  Battery pack, and battery voltage indicator 
- Lab 4:  Capacitive proximity sensor 
- Lab 5:  Light direction finder
- Lab 6:  Light-Following Robot
