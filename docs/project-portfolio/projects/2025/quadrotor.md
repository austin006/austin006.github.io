# Multi-Agent Quadrotor Hardware andÂ Simulation 

## :material-notebook: Description

Created a 3D-printed, crash-resistant, LLM-enabled quadrotor with high customizability to provide a platform for **multi-agent coordination** and **AI agent** research within the [**MAGICC Lab**](https://magicc.byu.edu/)

***

## :material-key: Key Takeaways

- Designed parametric CAD parts to construct a 3D printed quadrotor and spherical protection cage 
- Created Gazebo simulations of multiple quadrotors using ROS 2 communication and control
- Integrated an AI agent with ROS2 for natural-language control of multi-agent simulations

## :material-brain: Technical Skills

!!! tip "**Engineering Design**"
    Learned how to pioneer a new system through iterative design and testing. Created CAD models from ideas and sketches. 

!!! tip "**Manufacturing - 3D Printing**"
    Learned how to manufacture and fabricate various parts and components using various tools. Examples: custom parts with 3D printing, crimping and soldering, and more.

!!! tip "**AI Agent Development**"
    Learned how to create a custom AI agent using LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face, and Ollama

!!! tip "**Software**"
    Developed ability to create a robotic system in ROS 2 using Python. Introduced to Ubuntu and became proficient operating on a Linux system. Practiced good coding management and collaboration skills using GitHub. Created reproducable code by implementing a custom Docker container.

!!! tip "**Robotics/Electronics**"
    Gained experience with Gazebo and Rviz simulations. Learned how to use PX4 flight controllers (Pixhawk and Pixrace Pro). Used a Raspberry Pi to run ROS2 on a Linux OS to control the quadrotor mid-flight via ssh on a ground station laptop.
