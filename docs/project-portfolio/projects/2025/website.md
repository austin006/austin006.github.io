## :material-brain: Technical Skills

!!! tip "**Git and Github**"
    I practiced versioning and saving my work using [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F). I became  comfortable with managing code in an orgainized manner. I also gained a lot of confidence at using Github. I learned how to create websites using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and host them using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

!!! tip "**Markdown and HTML**"
    I learned how to use both [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) to create the webpages for this website.
