# Computer Aided Design (CAD) Portfolio

## :material-notebook: Description

I used, created, and evaluated engineering graphics including hand sketches, solid CAD models, renderings, engineering drawings, and animations. 

The work done here was performed in the course BYU ME EN 272: Engineering Graphics

***

## :material-target: Objectives

1. Become excellent at using engineering graphics to efficiently develop ideas into engineered designs.

## :material-brain: Technical Skills

!!! tip "**Mechanical Design**"
    As a mechanical designer, I learned to create something, evaluate it to uncover its weaknesses, then create fixes and reevaluate. I repeated this cycle many times, and understood that iteratively creating and evaluating is a fundemental part of the design process. Planning for iteration smooths out pain and frustration later on.

!!! tip "**CAD**"
    I learned many principles about becoming a designer with CAD software including: 
    
    * CAD model quality - parametric CAD, robustness, and easy iteration
    * CAD strategy - articulation of the steps needed to construct the model
    * Basic CAD process - purpose, strategy, model, iterate, present
