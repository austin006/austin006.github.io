## :material-notebook: Description

BYU CS 236 Discrete Math Projects. Over the course of this class we built a Datalog Scanner, Parser, Relational Database, Datalog interpreter and then optimized the rule evaluation. More information can be found [here](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~barker/cs236/labs/labs.php). Descriptions that are included below are taken verabutum from the class website. Projects build upon each other.

## :material-target: Objectives

**[Data Scanner](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~barker/cs236/labs/lab1-extra.html)** (Project 1): Write a scanner that reads a sequence of characters from a text file, identifies the datalog language tokens found in the file, and outputs each token.

**[Data Parser](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~barker/cs236/labs/lab2-extra.html)** (Project 2): Write a parser that reads a datalog program from a text file, builds a data structure that represents the datalog program, and outputs the contents of the datalog program data structure.

**[The Relational Database](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~barker/cs236/labs/lab3-extra.html)** (Project 3): Write an interpreter that uses relational database operations to evaluate the queries in a Datalog Program. For this project, use only the facts to evaluate the queries. (The evaluation of rules will be added in the next project.) 

**[The Datalog Interpreter](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~barker/cs236/labs/lab4-extra.html)** (Project 4): Add join and union operations to the relational database from the last project and use the new operations to evaluate the rules in a Datalog program. 

**[Optimizing Rule Evaluation](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~barker/cs236/labs/lab5-extra.html)** (Project 5): Build the dependency graph for the rules in a Datalog program and use depth-first search on the graph to improve the evaluation of the rules.
