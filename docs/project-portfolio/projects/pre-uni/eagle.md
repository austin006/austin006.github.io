# Eagle Scout Project - Grave Indexing

## :material-notebook: Description

For my Eagle Scout project, I helped St. Mary's church in England record gravestone information. We were able to create **paper and digital records** (with pictures) for over **500 graves** which had previously been unrecorded. This information was published online to become searchable for those performing family history work.
