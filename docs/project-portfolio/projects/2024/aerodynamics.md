[:simple-github: Github Repository](https://github.com/austin006/497R-Airframe-Design){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## :material-notebook: Description

This project consisted of **aerodynamic analysis** and **design optimization**, focusing on creating an optimal wing configuration for a simple airframe. Key characteristics such as chord and twist were optimized under specific conditions by leveraging the Julia packages **VortexLattice** for aerodynamic modeling and **SNOW** for its advanced nonlinear optimization and derivative computation capabilities.

    I completed this project as an undergraduate researcher in the [BYU FLOW Lab](https://flow.byu.edu/) under the guidance of a graduate student mentor. This project is based upon the [Airframe Design Track](https://github.com/byuflowlab/undergrad-onboarding/blob/master/497R/track_descriptions/airframe_design.md).
