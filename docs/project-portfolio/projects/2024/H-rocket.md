# Rocket with H Level Motor

## :material-notebook: Description

I successfully designed, built, launched, and safely recovered a rocket using a certifed motor in the H impulse category. In doing so, I recieved my Level 1 certification[^1]. I constructed this rocket by expanding upon skills and knowledge previously gained from building a simple rocket[^2] in a small team.
