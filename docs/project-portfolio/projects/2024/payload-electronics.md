## :material-notebook: Description

As a member of [BYU Spacecraft club](https://spacecraft.byu.edu/), I worked closely with a BYU Rocketry team to design a payload for their rocket. As one of 5 members on the payload team, I contributed by **setting up an altimeter** and connecting it with other components in the system. A big accomplishment was sending a **camera in our payload** to record in-flight footage.
