    "Without a portfolio, how else are you going to know I can do the things I say I can do?    
    Telling me says almost nothing, while showing me says almost everything. It’s that simple."[^1]

## Bio

![Profile Picture](assets/profile.jpg){ align=left width=25% style="border-radius: 50%; object-fit: cover;" }

<span style="font-size: 2em;">**Austin McGlashan**</span> 

After graduating high school, I lived in Brazil for two years as a religious volunteer. I began studying Mechanical Engineering at Brigham Young University in 2023. I love to learn and am driven by an insatiable curiosity of the world around me. Aside from my academic endeavors, I enjoy many other interests including sports and music.

<!-- I'm Austin, and at my core, I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity and a profound commitment to continuous learning. This fundamental desire to acquire new knowledge and skills propels me in all endeavors—whether it's excelling in challenging coursework, mastering the coordination of juggling on a unicycle, or executing a backflip. This website itself is a direct outcome of that passion; I wanted to build my own online space, viewed it as a compelling learning opportunity, and enthusiastically immersed myself in the process of bringing it to life. -->
